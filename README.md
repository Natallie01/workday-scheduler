# What to Expect (Functionality)
* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
